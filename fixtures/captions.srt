1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,490
Is it accurate that the
rank and file no longer

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,990
supported Director Comey?

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,650


5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,330
No, sir, that is not accurate.

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,190
I can tell you that
I hold Director Comey

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,190
in the absolute highest regard.

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,820
I have the highest respect
from his considerable abilities

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,620
and his integrity.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,320
And it has been the
greatest privilege

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,150
and honor of my professional
life to work with him.

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,850
I can tell you also
that Director Comey

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,730
enjoyed broad support within the
FBI and still does to this day.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,250
Yesterday a White
House press spokesman

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,990
said that this is
one of the smallest

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,820
things on the plate of the FBI.

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,783
Is that an accurate statement?

18
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:47,120


19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,246
Is this a small investigation
in relation to all

20
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:51,620
the other work
that you're doing?

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,720
Sir, we consider it to
be a highly significant

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,870
investigation.
